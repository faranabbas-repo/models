Using March 2024 YouGov survey data from 1,559 U.S. adults, we estimate the proportion of votes Joe Biden will receive in the November election.\nWe model support for Joe Biden—measured as a binary outcome of either intending to vote for him or not—as a logistic function of an intercept-only model, reflecting the baseline support level. Our estimates may be biased if late-deciding voters break differently for Biden than survey respondents who expressed firm preferences in March."
